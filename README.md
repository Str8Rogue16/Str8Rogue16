👋 Hello, I’m @Str8Rogue16

🔍 I specialize in OSINT and actively studying radio frequency communications, with a focus on both terrestrial and airborne signal interception.

🧠 Passionate about cybersecurity, signal intelligence, and pushing the boundaries of digital reconnaissance.

💻 Working extensively with Python and building robust applications using the .NET framework, while also developing my own Large Language Model (LLM).
